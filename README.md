Wanderer piano score
====================

This is the lilypond source for
[Wanderer (2005)](https://pteromys.melonisland.net/music/#wanderer).

The output is in C# as originally played, but the code is in D, being adapted
from a flute+piano arrangement from the dark ages before git was cool and
lilypond was sane.

Thankfully, computers are magic, so if you want to recompile it in whatever key
you like, it's as easy as:

```sh
make KEY=d
```
